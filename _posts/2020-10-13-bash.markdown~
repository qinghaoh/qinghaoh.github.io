[Tenth Line][tenth-line]

```bash

while (( i++ < 10 ))

  read line
done < file.txt
echo $line
```

```bash
tail -n +10 file.txt | head -1
```

```bash

# AWK

## Predefined Variables

awk divides the input into records and fields.

* NR: total number of input records read so far from all data files. It starts at zero and is never automatically reset to zero
* FNR: number of records that have been read so far from input. It's reset to zero every time a new file is started
* NF: number of fields in the current record

[Tenth Line][tenth-line]

```bash
awk 'NR == 10 {print; exit}' file.txt
```

```bash
awk 'FNR == 10 {print; exit}' file.txt
```

`END` rule is executed once only, after all the input is read. Cleanup actions.

[Transpose File][transpose-file]

```bash
awk '
{
    for (i = 1; i <= NF; i++) {
        if (NR == 1) {
            s[i] = $i;
        } else {
            s[i] = s[i] " " $i;
        }
    }
}
END {
    for (i = 1; s[i] != ""; i++) {
        print s[i];
    }
}' file.txt
```

## Print

[Word Frequency][word-frequency]

```bash
cat words.txt | tr -s ' ' '\n' | sort | uniq -c | sort -r | awk '{ print $2, $1 }'
```
