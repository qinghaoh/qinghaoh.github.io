| Feature                    | Immutable Variable (`let`)                      | `const` Variable                         |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Evaluation Time**        | Evaluated at runtime                           | Evaluated at compile time                |
| **Type Annotation**        | Optional (inferred if not provided)            | Required                                 |
| **Scope**                  | Local to the block in which it is declared     | Global or local, accessible anywhere     |
| **Usage**                  | Used for values that are immutable after being assigned, but determined at runtime | Used for fixed values known at compile time, typically constants used throughout the code |

Shadowing effectively creates a new variable with the same name as an existing one, allowing the reuse of the variable name while potentially altering its type or value.

```rust
let spaces = "    ";
let spaces = spaces.len();
```
