# Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm

[Boyerâ€“Moore majority vote algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boyer%E2%80%93Moore_majority_vote_algorithm): finds the majority of a sequence of elements using linear time and constant space.

[Majority Element][majority-element]

```c++
int majorityElement(vector<int>& nums) {
    int cnt = 0, candidate = numeric_limits<int>::max();
    for (int num : nums) {
        if (cnt == 0) {
            candidate = num;
        }
        cnt += (num == candidate) ? 1 : -1;
    }
    return candidate;
}
```
